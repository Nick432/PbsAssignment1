Github repository for our assignment

current contents are the base chat application, 
which uses rabbit mq's  api to set up a basic chat room users can connect to and post messages in "rooms".

next steps are to add more rooms , instead of the hard coded single room the app currently joins
we need multiple rooms the user can choose to join.

also need a gui for selecting the rooms and the chat room itself.
