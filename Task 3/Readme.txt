This is the Task 3 folder. I have the basic outline of the program done in three seperate files.
The Tracker/Person and Query files.
The tracker is run first, then the Person is run after, it has a command line argument to add different names so it can run multiple times. The query is to bring back any contacts for a particular person. Same format for command line arguments.
